## JRM-HW4-APICodeQuiz

# Purpose 
The purpose of this assignment was for the student to present what they are currently capable of constructing with the use of multiple js functions and Local APIs.

# Process
After establishing a basic html in order to separate the quiz from the timer and the submit function, the majority of this assignment was completed in the js scripting. In not finding an appropriate way to implement a failing scenario, I set the timer to refresh the page when it reached the end of the countdown instead.
